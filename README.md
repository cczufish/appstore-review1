Reasons
17.2: Apps that require users to share personal information, such as email address and date of birth, in order to function will be rejected

we found that your app requires customers to register with personal information such as a phone number to access non-account-based features, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.

Apps cannot require user registration prior to allowing access to app features and content that are not associated specifically to the user. User registration that requires the sharing of personal information must be optional or tied to account-specific functionality. Additionally, the requested information must be relevant to the features.

Hello, and thank you for your response.

While the app does not require registration, the app still requires the user's phone number in order to register for an account. 

We look forward to reviewing your app once this information is optional when registering.

Reasons

16.1: Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected 
Information Needed 
Hello, and thank you for your response.

With regard to social network logins such as QQ and Sina, it would be appropriate to implement additional account features into the app or provide users the option to log in via a native account. 

We look forward to reviewing your app once the issue is resolved.

Reasons

10.6: Apple and our customers place a high value on simple, refined, creative, well thought through interfaces. They take more work but are worth it. Apple sets a high bar. If your user interface is complex or less than very good, it may be rejected 
----- 10.6 -----

We found that your app requires the installation of another app before it can be used, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. Apps should be able to run on launch, without requiring additional applications to be installed.

Specifically, if we choose to log in via QQ, we were required to install QQ before we could use your app. Please refer to the attached screenshot/s for more information.

Please revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use a method that can authenticate users from within your app.

----- 17.2 -----

We found that your app uses æ–°æµª and Qzone logins for authentication purposes only - but does not include any account-based features offered by that site. This is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.

It would be appropriate to modify your app to include account-based features of that social network - or use your own authentication mechanism.

First of all, thank you for your review.
We note that you mentioned we used Sina and QQ authorized login, and did not use other account-based functions of them. But in fact, that's not true.

The first, If the user is interested in the article and want to submit comment, the nickname and the gender attribute are needed. To found out this function, you just need enter the detail page of any article(click an item on home page), the first button of the buttons at the bottom of the detail page is the comment button.

The second is when the user share the article to his/her socail network, the information of the third party account will be used.To found out this function, you just need enter the detail page of any article(click an item on home page), the last button of the buttons at the bottom of the detail page is the shared button.

Thank you for your response. However, sharing and commenting features are not significant enough. Please include your own authentication in the app. We look forward to your resubmission.

Reasons

14.3: Apps that display user generated content must include a method for filtering objectionable material, a mechanism for users to flag offensive content, and the ability to block abusive users from the service
----- 14.3 -----

Your app still enables the display of user-generated content but does not have the recommended precautions in place, as required by the App Store Review Guidelines.

It is necessary that you put all of the following precautions in place:

- Require that users agree to terms (EULA) and these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content
- Use moderators to flag and remove inappropriate content and offensive users
- Users need a mechanism to flag objectionable content and report users generating this content 
- Developer must act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content
- Developer needs a method for ejecting users who violate the terms of the EULA
